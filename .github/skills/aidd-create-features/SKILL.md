# aidd-create-features

Create independently understandable feature outcomes without mixing ticket execution details.

Apply [../planning-artifact-lifecycle.md](../planning-artifact-lifecycle.md)
for record paths, status classification, index synchronization, and
open/closed moves.
Apply [../development-mode.md](../development-mode.md) when resolving phase
approval and the feature-to-ticket handoff.

## Contract

  inputs[]
  outputs[]
  filesRead[]
  filesWritten[]
  sideEffects[]

  mayPush = false
  mayMerge = false
}
```

## Inputs

- Repository root and the relevant approved planning artifact IDs.
- `.github/aidd-config.yml` when present; its artifact paths, vocabulary, statuses, depth, and approval rules override defaults.
- Existing ancestor/child records, repository map, requirements, decisions, and evidence available at configured paths.
- The feature index and every record in both the configured feature `open` and
  `closed` directories.
- User request and any explicitly supplied constraints; unknowns remain unresolved.

## Outputs

- Markdown/SudoLang planning result or an explicitly authorized artifact update.
- One record per feature under the configured feature `open` directory, plus
  an updated feature index/list containing current paths for open and closed
  features.
- Stable IDs using configured prefixes (`OBJ`, `SCOPE`, `CAP`, `PHASE`, `FEAT`, `TICKET`), explicit status, parent/child links, and coverage/evidence links.
- A concise readiness, approval, warning, or blocker report; no implied downstream work.

## Side effects and ownership

- This skill owns only the planning layer named in its title and its review/report output.
- It may write only configured planning artifacts when the caller authorizes mutation; otherwise it is read-only.
- New feature records are created in `open`. An authorized transition to a
  configured closed status moves the same record to `closed` and synchronizes
  the feature index; reopening moves it back to `open`.
- It never owns implementation, branches, commits, pushes, merges, provider operations, or delivery readiness.
- Every write records owner, reason, source/evidence links, timestamp or revision, and affected IDs; preserve history rather than overwrite it.

## Boundaries

- Canonical hierarchy is **objective -> scope -> capability -> phase -> feature -> ticket**.
- Use adaptive depth: lightweight for a small fix or documentation change, standard for a meaningful change, full for a broad initiative; never invent layers merely for ceremony.
- A child requires one existing, unblocked, approved parent. No silent downstream generation, fan-out, or scope expansion.
- Preserve stable IDs on rename; maintain explicit statuses (`draft`, `confirmed`, `needs-review`, `blocked`, `complete`) and valid transitions.
- Keep requirements observable and implementation-agnostic. Reject cross-parent or oversized work when it cannot be independently verified.

## Metadata and traceability

Every artifact or report must include: ID, title, status, parent ID(s), objective/scope ancestry, capability/phase/feature links as applicable, owner, source paths, dependencies, risks, non-goals, affected surfaces, approval state, evidence/coverage links, and last-updated revision or timestamp. A ticket is traceable only when it links back to its objective and forward to requirements, protected behaviors, gates, and an evidence path.

## Failure and blocker behavior

Missing parent, approval, evidence, command, ownership, or required capability is a blocker or coverage gap—not a pass. Stop before child generation or readiness claims, name the exact missing input and affected IDs, and propose the smallest next action. Material changes route to `aidd-change-control`; routine corrections must not masquerade as a replan.

## Process

```sudolang
createFeatures(request) => FeatureIndex {
  1. require an approved, unblocked phase and its capability links
  2. read both feature status directories and preserve existing FEAT IDs
  3. create stable FEAT IDs in the feature open directory; each feature belongs to exactly one phase and at least one capability
  4. record outcome, scope, non-goals, dependencies, risks, affected surfaces, acceptance outcomes, and evidence plan
  5. synchronize the feature index with every current record path
  6. move a record between open and closed only when its authorized status transition changes classification
  7. preserve IDs on rename and retain unresolved decisions as blockers or needs-review
  8. obtain feature approval before generating tickets in guided mode; in
     automatic mode, record the bootstrap-authorized decision and continue
     after verified writes without asking or waiting
}
```

## Constraints

```sudolang
Constraints {
  Read configured artifacts and applicable ancestors before proposing changes
  Read both open and closed feature directories; never create duplicate IDs
  Create new features in open and move records when status classification changes
  Keep feature index entries synchronized with current record paths
  Preserve path history and stable IDs across status moves
  Do not claim readiness without terminal evidence for every required gate
  In automatic mode, do not classify feature coverage or readiness without the
    exact Rubber Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning `all-validation` profile
  Do not create or modify artifacts outside the named planning layer
  Escalate ambiguity, conflict, or material change instead of guessing
  In automatic mode, never generate children from a missing, blocked, or
    contradictory feature
}
```

## Commands

```sudolang
Commands {
  /create-features [phase-id]
  - propose features for one approved phase only
}
```
