# aidd-push

`aidd-push` safely publishes an already-reviewed local commit with current
agent-owned technical, automated functionality, and mode-appropriate validation
evidence to its configured remote branch. It does not stage, commit,
force-push, create a PR, or merge anything by default.

## Usage

Use `/push` after `/commit` when the local branch is unpublished or ahead of
its upstream. In automatic mode, the orchestrator performs this configured
operation without asking, while preserving all branch and provider blockers.
After the remote ref is verified, the workflow routes to `/aidd-pr` when
repository policy requires a pull request.

## When to use

- A successful local commit needs to be published
- A review-fix commit must be sent to an existing PR branch
- Remote CI or a configured preview requires the branch to be pushed
