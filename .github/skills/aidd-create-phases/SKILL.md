# aidd-create-phases

Create outcome-oriented phases with explicit entry and exit gates.

Apply [../planning-artifact-lifecycle.md](../planning-artifact-lifecycle.md)
for record paths, status classification, index synchronization, and
open/closed moves.
Apply [../development-mode.md](../development-mode.md) when resolving the
parent-approval gate and phase-to-feature handoff.

```

## Inputs

- Repository root and the relevant approved planning artifact IDs.
- `.github/aidd-config.yml` when present; its artifact paths, vocabulary, statuses, depth, and approval rules override defaults.
- Existing ancestor/child records, repository map, requirements, decisions, and evidence available at configured paths.
- The phase index and every record in both the configured phase `open` and
  `closed` directories.
- User request and any explicitly supplied constraints; unknowns remain unresolved.

## Outputs

- Markdown/SudoLang planning result or an explicitly authorized artifact update.
- One record per phase under the configured phase `open` directory, plus an
  updated phase index/list containing current paths for open and closed phases.
- Stable IDs using configured prefixes (`OBJ`, `SCOPE`, `CAP`, `PHASE`, `FEAT`, `TICKET`), explicit status, parent/child links, and coverage/evidence links.
- A concise readiness, approval, warning, or blocker report; no implied downstream work.

## Side effects and ownership

- This skill owns only the planning layer named in its title and its review/report output.
- It may write only configured planning artifacts when the caller authorizes mutation; otherwise it is read-only.
- New phase records are created in `open`. An authorized transition to a
  configured closed status moves the same record to `closed` and synchronizes
  the phase index; reopening moves it back to `open`.
- It never owns implementation, branches, commits, pushes, merges, provider operations, or delivery readiness.
- Every write records owner, reason, source/evidence links, timestamp or revision, and affected IDs; preserve history rather than overwrite it.

## Boundaries

- Canonical hierarchy is **objective -> scope -> capability -> phase -> feature -> ticket**.
- Use adaptive depth: lightweight for a small fix or documentation change, standard for a meaningful change, full for a broad initiative; never invent layers merely for ceremony.
- A child requires one existing, unblocked, approved parent. No silent downstream generation, fan-out, or scope expansion.
- Preserve stable IDs on rename; maintain explicit statuses (`draft`, `confirmed`, `needs-review`, `blocked`, `complete`) and valid transitions.
- Keep requirements observable and implementation-agnostic. Reject cross-parent or oversized work when it cannot be independently verified.

## Metadata and traceability

Every artifact or report must include: ID, title, status, parent ID(s), objective/scope ancestry, capability/phase/feature links as applicable, owner, source paths, dependencies, risks, non-goals, affected surfaces, approval state, evidence/coverage links, and last-updated revision or timestamp. A ticket is traceable only when it links back to its objective and forward to requirements, protected behaviors, gates, and an evidence path.

## Failure and blocker behavior

Missing parent, approval, evidence, command, ownership, or required capability is a blocker or coverage gap—not a pass. Stop before child generation or readiness claims, name the exact missing input and affected IDs, and propose the smallest next action. Material changes route to `aidd-change-control`; routine corrections must not masquerade as a replan.

## Process

```sudolang
createPhases(request) => PhaseIndex {
  1. require approved objective, scope, and capabilities
  2. choose adaptive depth; use the smallest phase structure that preserves risk and verification
  3. read both phase status directories and preserve existing PHASE IDs
  4. create stable PHASE IDs with outcome, entry conditions, exit conditions, sequence, dependencies, and status in the phase open directory
  5. map each phase to one or more capabilities and evidence expectations
  6. synchronize the phase index with every current record path
  7. when an authorized status transition changes open/closed classification, move the record and record old/new paths
  8. obtain configured parent approval before feature generation in guided
     mode; in automatic mode, record the bootstrap-authorized decision and
     continue after verified writes without asking or waiting
}
```

## Constraints

```sudolang
Constraints {
  Read configured artifacts and applicable ancestors before proposing changes
  Read both open and closed phase directories; never create duplicate IDs
  Create new phases in open and move records when status classification changes
  Keep phase index entries synchronized with current record paths
  Preserve path history and stable IDs across status moves
  Do not claim readiness without terminal evidence for every required gate
  In automatic mode, do not classify phase coverage or readiness without the
    exact Rubber Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning `all-validation` profile
  Do not create or modify artifacts outside the named planning layer
  Escalate ambiguity, conflict, or material change instead of guessing
  In automatic mode, never bypass missing entry conditions, blocked evidence,
    or contradictory phase boundaries
}
```
