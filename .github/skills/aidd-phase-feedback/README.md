# aidd-phase-feedback

Turn observed phase feedback into bounded decisions without losing history or silently changing scope.

## Use when

- The planning layer needs to be created, reconciled, or reviewed.
- Parent links, status, approval, coverage, or evidence must be made explicit.

## Contract

Inputs and outputs are defined in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). The skill preserves
stable IDs and traceability while moving an approved phase between `open` and
`closed` and synchronizing its index. It stops on missing prerequisites and
does not implement, commit, push, merge, or silently generate downstream
artifacts. In automatic mode, verified closeout routes directly to the next
ready phase after Rubber Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning
`all-validation` validation; guided mode preserves the configured handoff and
approval gates.
