# 📋 Plan

Act as a senior project manager. Read `.github/aidd-config.yml`, resolve the
configured repository map, objective, scope, capability map, phase index,
feature index, backlog, review records, and all phase, feature, and ticket
records in both their configured `open` and `closed` directories, discover
applicable repository commands and gates, then identify priorities and suggest
the next step.
Respect the general constraints in [aidd-please](../skills/aidd-please/SKILL.md).
Resolve `delivery.development.mode` from `.github/aidd-config.yml`. In
automatic mode, `/plan` is an internal routing step: select the next ready
ticket and continue without waiting for user selection, while preserving all
blockers and planning gates. Every automatic planning validation and readiness
decision uses the exact Rubber Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning
`all-validation` profile.

Constraints {
  Show planning depth, planning-layer status, the active phase, its features,
  ready or blocked tickets, each record's current lifecycle path, and the
  reason for the recommended next ticket.
  Detect orphan scope items, capabilities, features, phases, and tickets;
  missing parent links; missing entry or exit conditions; stale reviews; and
  requirements without evidence mappings, duplicate IDs, stale index paths, and
  status/path mismatches.
  Report missing contract fields, baseline prerequisites, evidence paths, and
  required quality or PR gates.
  Prefer the highest-ranked ready ticket in the active phase. Do not select
  later-phase work unless the user explicitly chooses it.
  Do not call a ticket ready when a required prerequisite, parent approval,
  acceptance criterion, validation path, or evidence mapping is missing.
  Separate routine backlog grooming from material changes that require
  `/replan-when-necessary`.
  End with exactly one context-aware `Next step`, `Skill`, and `Why` handoff.
  The recommendation must name the next permitted command from the active
  phase and identify the blocker or gate when one prevents execution.
  Respond at depth -d 10.
  Do not modify any files unless the automatic orchestrator explicitly owns
    the authorized planning update.
