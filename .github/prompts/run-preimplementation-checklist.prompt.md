# Run-Preimplementation-Checklist

Use [../skills/aidd-preimplementation-checklist/SKILL.md](../skills/aidd-preimplementation-checklist/SKILL.md) as the executable contract.
Read `delivery.development.mode` from `.github/aidd-config.yml`. In automatic
mode, a ready result is an internal handoff to TDD and does not wait for a
separate execution approval; the checklist decision must use the exact Rubber
Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning `all-validation` profile.

userPrompt = """
Run a read-only preimplementation checklist for one ticket. Verify complete objective-to-ticket ancestry, approvals, stable IDs, status, current open/closed path, scope/non-goals, dependencies, risks, ownership, protected behaviors, commands, gates, evidence path, exact user-validation steps, pass criteria, and the configured baseline prerequisite or terminal baseline evidence. Reject a closed ticket or closed ancestor as active work. Return ready=true only when every required check passes; otherwise list exact blockers and do not implement.
"""

Constraints {
  Treat paths as repository-relative and read `.github/aidd-config.yml` when present
  Read both lifecycle directories and do not move records during this check
  Require the selected ticket and active phase/feature ancestors to be in open
  Use canonical objective -> scope -> capability -> phase -> feature -> ticket ancestry
  Use adaptive depth, stable IDs, parent/child links, explicit statuses, and evidence/coverage links
  Do not silently generate downstream artifacts, expand scope, or claim readiness without terminal evidence
  Stop and report the exact blocker for missing parent, approval, evidence, ownership, or required capability
  In automatic mode, record bootstrap-authorized execution approval but never
    bypass missing prerequisites or ask a follow-up question; classify the
    result with the exact Rubber Duck `gpt-5.6-luna` high-reasoning
    `all-validation` profile
  Do not assume npm, GitHub, Azure, credentials, or a particular test runner
